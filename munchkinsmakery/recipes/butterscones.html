            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preparing the Oven<br>
                    Preheat your oven to 220°C/fan 200°C/gas mark 7. Lightly grease a baking sheet or line it with parchment paper.</li>
                <li>Combining Dry Ingredients<br>
                    In a large bowl, sift the self-raising flour and add the cubed cold unsalted butter. Use your fingertips to rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.</li>
                <li>Adding Sweetness<br>
                    Stir in the caster sugar, ensuring it is evenly distributed throughout the mixture.</li>
                <li>Mixing Wet Ingredients<br>
                    In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and milk together. Pour the mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until a soft dough forms.</li>
                <li>Kneading the Dough<br>
                    Transfer the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Gently knead it a few times until it comes together and becomes smooth.</li>
                <li>Shaping the Scones<br>
                    Roll out the dough to a thickness of about 2cm. Use a round cookie cutter to cut out scones from the dough. Place them onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving a little space between each scone.</li>
                <li>Baking Time<br>
                    Optional: Brush the tops of the scones with a little milk for a golden finish. Bake them in the preheated oven for 12-15 minutes or until they are risen and golden brown.</li>
                <li>Serving Warm<br>
                    Remove the scones from the oven and transfer them to a wire rack to cool slightly. Serve them warm with clotted cream and your favorite jam.</li>
            </ol>
