<div class="instructions">
  <h2>Instructions:</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preparing the Oven<br>
      Heat your oven to 190C/fan170C/gas 5. Line two baking sheets with non-stick baking paper to prevent the cookies from sticking.</li>
    <li>Creaming the Butter and Sugars<br>
      In a bowl, combine 150g softened salted butter, 80g light brown muscovado sugar, and 40g granulated sugar. Beat the mixture until it becomes creamy and well blended.</li>
    <li>Adding Flavors<br>
      To enhance the taste, add 2 tsp of vanilla extract and crack in the large egg. Beat the mixture again until all the ingredients are well incorporated.</li>
    <li>Mixing the Dry Ingredients<br>
      Sift 225g plain flour, ½ tsp bicarbonate of soda, and ¼ tsp salt into the bowl containing the butter-sugar mixture. Mix the dry ingredients thoroughly with the wet ingredients until a smooth dough forms.</li>
    <li>Adding Chocolate Goodness<br>
      Add 200g plain chocolate chips or chunks to the dough. Stir well to evenly distribute the chocolate throughout the mixture, ensuring every bite is filled with luscious chocolate goodness.</li>
    <li>Chilling the Dough<br>
      For best results, place the dough in the fridge for 1-2 hours. This will allow the flavors to meld together and the dough to firm up.</li>
    <li>Baking Time<br>
      Preheat your oven to the same temperature as before. Take the chilled dough and use a teaspoon to scoop small portions, placing them onto the lined baking trays. Remember to space the scoops well apart to allow room for spreading. This recipe typically yields about 30 cookies.</li>
    <li>Perfectly Baked Cookies<br>
      Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes or until they turn light brown around the edges, with a slightly soft center when gently pressed. The aroma filling your kitchen will be simply irresistible.</li>
    <li>Cooling and Enjoying<br>
      Allow the cookies to cool on the baking trays for a couple of minutes to set, then transfer them onto a cooling rack. For optimal texture, we recommend letting the cookies sit for 1-2 days before indulging. This waiting period allows them to become softer and chewier, delivering the ultimate cookie experience.</li>
  </ol>
