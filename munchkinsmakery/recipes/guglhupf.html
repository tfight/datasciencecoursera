            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preparing the Oven<br>
                    Preheat your oven to 180°C/fan 160°C/gas mark 4. Grease a Guglhupf or bundt cake pan with butter or cooking spray, ensuring all crevices are well coated.</li>
                <li>Creaming the Butter and Sugar<br>
                    In a large bowl, cream together the softened unsalted butter and caster sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
                <li>Adding Eggs and Vanilla<br>
                    Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each egg is fully incorporated before adding the next. Stir in the vanilla extract.</li>
                <li>Mixing the Dry Ingredients<br>
                    Sift the self-raising flour and baking powder into the bowl with the wet ingredients. Gently fold the dry ingredients into the batter until just combined.</li>
                <li>Adding Milk<br>
                    Stir in the milk to achieve a smooth and creamy batter.</li>
                <li>Creating the Marble Effect<br>
                    Divide the batter equally into two separate bowls. In one bowl, sift the cocoa powder and mix it well to create a chocolate batter.</li>
                <li>Assembling the Cake<br>
                    Spoon alternating dollops of vanilla and chocolate batter into the prepared Guglhupf pan, creating a marbled effect. Use a skewer or knife to gently swirl the batters together, but do not overmix.</li>
                <li>Baking Time<br>
                    Place the pan in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 45-50 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Cooling and Serving<br>
                    Allow the cake to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then carefully transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, dust the cake with icing sugar and serve it as a stunning centerpiece.</li>
            </ol>
